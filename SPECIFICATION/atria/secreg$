%%`/0%%:[SRQ]OPSERT: Retrieve SOC%%%

The SRF Retrieval expects a single 16-bit parameter (p16[0]) indicating
the Secretariat ID (SID) of interest.

If the indicated Secretariat's Registration File is accessible and the
secretariat is not in lockdown, SECREG$ will fill out the SOC which
should be placed on (pointed to by) the case board.

SECREG$[SRQ]OPSERT& will always attach a XERIS Standard Report ticket
to the Work Order. The possible Stubs and SOSES Codes are as follows:

SECREG$ will never write any data unless the retrieval is successful.
