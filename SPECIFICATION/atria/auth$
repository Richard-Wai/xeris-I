%%!xeris%atria%%$auth%%:ATRIA Authorization Registration Service%%%

%%`0%%:Introduction%%%

The ATRIA Authorization Registration Service module (atria%auth$)
provides authorization assessment of the dispatch next-hop route
configuration.

ATRIA%AUTH$ is fully modular behind the specified behavior described
within this operational specification. There is no conceptual
specification for the auth$ module, and the operational specification
is deliberately simple, to allow wide implementation flexibility.


%%`1%%:Submission Procedure%%%

AUTH$ accepts only a XERIS Standard Service Request Ticket (xst_srq),
and responds only with a XERIS Standard Report Ticket (xst_rpt).

AUTH$ may provide additional implementation-specific services as
needed. The below-listed service codes are required for the proper
function of the XERIS/APEX nodal core ("FOSA").

Codes 0000 - 00ff are reserved for XERIS/APEX specified services.

The service requests codes accepted by AUTH$ are as follows:

Code       Service Description
0000       Current-Outbound Route Assessment


An invalid service code results in a xst_rpt return of Spec/Code
0000/5002 (OP-F-SVC_UNAVAIL).
