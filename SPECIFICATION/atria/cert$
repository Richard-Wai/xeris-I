%%`0%%:Introduction%%%

The ATRIA% Track Origin Certification Service module (atria%cert$)
provides origin track verification to OPSEC%.

CERT$ accepts a ATRIA Desk Card (adc) non-standard ticket which points
to any instruction address within a secretariat, and carries the
expected origin track value.

CERT$ verifies if the instruction address is within the instruction
space of the secretariat associated with the indicated track.

CERT$ always returns a XERIS Standard Report Ticket (xst_rpt), with
only three possible Spec/Code pairs.


%%`1%%:Submission Procedure%%%

The ATRIA Dispatch Card non-standard ticket (nst_atria_adc) submitted to CERT$
should be filled-out as follows:

Field                Value
trk                  Suspected Origin Track Number
xsdo (*ldd) (xsdo)   Instruction address of interest

CERT$ will then return a XERIS Standard Report Ticket of one of the
following three configurations:
