%%!xeris%atria%%$ctxm%%:ATRIA% Secretariat Context Management%%%

%%`0%%:Introduction%%%

The ATRIA% Secretariat Context Management operator (atria%ctxm$)
manages the global working memory of the relevant secretariat as
assigned to a local Outbound Track.

In the XERIS/APEX system, a Secretariat Context refers to the state of
shared data within that Secretariat, namely "bss" and "data"
sections. Run-time context in the form of stacks, registers, and other
task-specific data represents the Dispatch context.

On larger systems, ctxm$ can provide critical fault-tolerance and
recovery infrastructure by allowing saves, restores, and transfers of
active contexts.

%%`1%%:Submission Procedure%%%

CTXM$ accepts only XERIS Standard Service Request Tickets, however
its capability is extendable through the introduction of additional
ATRIA% support operators.

CTXM$ always returns a XERIS Standard Report Ticket.

This specification covers only the most basic, standard operations.

Codes 0000 - 00ff are reserved for base specified service, as contained
within this specification. Implementation specific services may be
implemented from 0100 and higher.

Base Specified Service Codes:

Code     Service Description
0000     General Initialization
0001     Single Initialization
0002     Set-point Store
0003     Set-point Recall

An invalid service code results in a xst_rpt return of Spec/Code
0000/5002 (OP-F-SVC_UNAVAIL).

%%`2%%:Service Code Operational Specifications%%%

%%`/0%%:0000 - Autonomous General Initialization%%%

This service re-loads the data sections, and initializes to zero the
entire bss section of the specified Track's associated Secretariat,
from locally integrated storage. It then configures the active
dispatch zone file to conform to the largest available contiguous area
of executive memory available for dispatch execution.

This mode is intended to be invoked directly from FLATLINE%OMNI$
during node initialization.

Any submissions to CTXM$ always expect the active OPCON location to be
passed on the dispatch board.

Service Request Ticket Fields:

Field    Value
rqc      0000
p16[0]   Loader Select

%%`//3%%:p16[0] - Loader Select%%%

This value is implementation - specific, but indicates to ATIRA% the
loader module for .data initialization.

A value of zero shall always represent a "default" or "nominal"
configuration. 

This service will always return a XERIS Standard Report Ticket of the
following possible configurations:

Spec/Code    Human Code         Indication
0000/0001    OP-S-OPR_OK        Operational Was Successful
0000/5005    OP-F-WRITE_UNABLE  Unable to write
0000/5006    OP-F-READ_UNABLE   Unable to read
0000/5009    OP-F-NO_TRACK      Invalid Track
0000/500f    OP-F-OPTION_UNKN   Invalid Loader Selection
0000/500d    OP-F-DATA_CORRUPT  Source Data is corrupt
0000/500e    OP-F-EC_UNABLE     Error correction failed
0000/500f    OP-F-VERIFY_FAIL   Write verification failed
0000/5004    OP-F-ACCESS_DENIED Source access denied by other operator
