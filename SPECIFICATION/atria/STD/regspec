%%!xeris%atria%%*regspec%%:ATRIA General Registration Specification%%%

%%`1%%:Introduction%%%

The most seminal role of ATRIA is the registration of new Secretariats
within the local node. This specification describes the protocol
through which ATRIA receives and processes new Secretariat
Registrations.

%%`2%%:Registration Tags%%%

ATRIA Registration Tags are a standardized set of tickets which
provide the necessary registration information for the dynamic loading
and registration of new Secretariats with a XERIS/APEX node.

A Registration Package is a conceptual collection of data
(instructions, and initialized memory) that are maintained at
source. ATRIA then makes use of a special set of XERIS Standard
Tickets, known as Registration Tags, specified in this specification
to procedurally load, commission, and register a new Secretariat.

Registration Tags are represented by a set of private XERIS Tickets
specified in this specification, and summarized as follows:

STUB      Code     Tag Name
TAG_PRT   0xf0     Partition Tag
TAG_ADR   0xf1     Address Tag
TAG_UNI   0xf2     Unit Tag
TAG_COM   0xf3     Commission Tag
TAG_DAT   0xf4     Data Tag
TAG_MAN   0xf5     Human Reference Tag

TAG_XFR   0xf6     Transfer Slip

Each Tag type is itself identified by a category-specific Tag
Identification Number (Tag ID). Tags are always arranged as contiguous
vectors of a reserved address space provision that correlates with the
tag type. The Tag ID is a 16-bit unsigned integer. No IDs are
reserved.

The Tag Identification Number (ident) always occupies the first 16
bits of every Registration Tag. However, the ident value of any
Registration Ticket refers only to a position in a vector of
like-stubbed tickets, which always begins at ident 0x0001, and shall
always be contiguous.

A Tag Identification of 0x0000 is reserved for all stubs, and shall
either never be present, or always be present, in accordance with the
stub-specific specification found in Section 2.

%%`2/1%%:Parition Tag%%%

Partition Tags describe address spaces referenced by a Secretariat
during registration, commissioning, and service. The address space of
a partition should be considered physically distinct from all other
partitions, but may be implemented logically. A partition is defined
by a single define role, purpose, function, use, or property.

Partition Tags 0x0000 - 0x1fff are reserved for global partition types
that are provided by the XERIS/APEX Specification. The current
collection of reserved partitions are described in this section, and
include:

Ident   Code     Description
0x0000  NUL      Null partition
0x0001  EXE      Executive Partition
0x0002  OP1      First Operations Partition
0x0003  OP2      Second Operations Partition
0x0004  REF      Static Reference Partition
0x0005  SYS      System/Control Partition
0x0006  XFL      Trans-FLATLINE Partition
0x0007  MAN      Human Reference Partition

All XERIS/APEX nodes must recognize NUL,REG, and EXE partitions at a
minimum, and are recommend to recognize NUL, REG, EXE, INI, and OPR
at a minimum.

All partitions must have a link to a partition of a lesser
identification, except for the NULL partition, which links to itself.

XERIS/APEX Standard Partitions are described in more detail in the
ident field specification in the next subsection.

%%`2/1/1%%:Partition Tag Specification%%%

A Partition Tag is a XERIS Standard Ticket with the following fields:

Field    Type      Description
ident    uint16    Tag ID

word     uint16    [Data Tag]Word size in bits
align    uint16    [Data Tag]Ultimate alignment (multiples of words)
ovrly    uint16    [Unit Tag]Overlay Unit
extnt    uint16    [Address Tag]

%%`2/1/1/1%%:ident Field%%%

The ident field carries the package global Tag Identification number
for the tag.

In the case of Partition Tags, the ident field may indicate specific
standardized representations, which are described in this sub-section.



%%`2/1/1/1/0%%:NUL: Null Partition%%%

The Null Partition is conceptual in nature. It has an infinite address
space, and always contains a zero value at all locations.

The Null Partition is typically used in the Partition link field
wherever an actual link does not exist, and ensures full
zero-initialization of a partition.

%%`2/1/1/1/1%%:EXE: Executive Partition%%%

The Executive Partition represents an immutable instruction space. The
Executive Parition shall never be modifiable at run-time.

The Executive Partition must be linked to the Registration Partition,
or is otherwise illegal.

%%`2/1/1/1/2%%:OPR1 and OPR2: Operational Partition%%%

The First and Second Operational Partitions represent a fixed
reservation of local, random-access, private working memory. The memory
space will be initialized by ATRIA according to the link field at
FLATLINE.

Operational Partitions must always have a valid Overlay Unit. An
Operational Partition Tag with a Overlay Unit value of 0x0000 is
illegal.

XERIS/APEX requires that all private working memory is explicitly
initialized during FLATLINE.

%%`2/1/1/1/4%%:REF: Static Reference Partition%%%

The Static Reference Partition represents a fixed reservation of local
non-volatile, but read-only data. ATRIA may facility modification of
the partition contents pre-FLATLINE. However, the commissioned
Secretariat shall not have the ability to directly modify the contents
of the Static Reference Partition.

The Static Reference partition must be linked to the Registration
Partition only.

%%`2/1/1/1/4%%:SYS: System/Control Partition%%%

The System/Control Partition is architecture/implementation-specific,
but generally represents a register-mapped space for control of the
system and or peripheral devices.

The meaning and application of a link value is
architecture/implementation-defined.

%%`2/1/1/1/5%%:XFL: Trans-FLATLINE Partition%%%

The Trans-FLATLINE Partition represents a private reserved,
implementation-specific random-access memory space which is preserved
over FLATLINE events.


%%`2/1/1/1/6%%:MAN: Human Reference Partition%%%

The Human Reference Partition contains a single UTF-encoded octet
string of human-readable characters. Human Reference Tags included in
the Package reference specific slices in the target array. Encoding
that is not UTF-8 shall have the appropriate encoding markers at the
beginning of the partition.

The Human Reference Partition must always have a word size of
8-bits.

This partition may be ignored by at the discretion of the target node.

%%`2/1/1/2%%:word Field%%%

The word field carries a Data Tag ID, which itself carries the word
size of the provisioned address space, in bits. Endianness shall be
global for a package wherever it is relevant. The endianness shall
match that indicated in Data Tag 0x0000

A word value referring to Data Tag 0x0000 is invalid and indicates that
the partition tag is inactive and shall be ignored.

%%`2/1/1/3%%:align Field%%%

The align field carries a Data Tag ID, which itself carries an
integral required physical alignment, in words.

A align value referring to Data Tag 0x0000 is invalid and indicates
that the partition tag is inactive and shall be ignored.

%%`2/1/1/4%%:ovrly field - Unit Overlay%%%

The Unit Overlay field contains a Unit Tag ID which points to a Unit
Tag which must have the same size as the partition to which it is
related.

A Unit Tag ID of 0x0000 indicates that there is no overlay.

%%`2/1/1/5%%:extnt field%%%

The extnt field carries an Address Tag identification which must be
self referencing to the Partition. The address identified in the extnt
field shall be the last accessible word of the Partition.

A extnt value refering to Address Tag 0x0000 is invalid and indicates
that the partition tag is inactive and shall be ignored.

%%`2/2%%:Address Tag%%%

Address Tags address a specific word in a Partition. Address tags also
provide identification information for linking purposes

%%`2/2/1%%:Address Tag Specification%%%

An Address Tag is a XERIS Standard Ticket with the following feilds

Field    Type      Description
ident    uint16    Tag ID

part	 unit16	   [Parition Tag]Referenced partition
segt	 uint16	   [Data Tag]Segment Number (x 0x10000000000000000)
offs	 uint16	   [Data Tag]Word offset into segment
unit	 uint16    [Unit Tag]Associated unit

%%`2/2/1/1%%:ident: Tag Identification Field%%%

The Tag Identification Field is unique for each Address Tag in a
Registration Package.

Address Tag 0x0000 is reserved. Its meaning shall never be considered
as a valid address, and typically indicates the lack of an assigned
address.

%%`2/2/1/2%%:part: Referenced Partition%%%

The 'part' field contains a Partition Tag Identification which
identifies the target partition for which the address applies.

%%`2/2/1/3%%:segt: Segment Number%%%

The segment number contains a Data Tag Identification, which itself
contains a 64-bit unsigned number which is effectively an offset prefix
of 0x1 0000 0000 0000 0000. That is to say, each segment represents a
64-bit address segment.

A Data Tag Identification of zero indicates Segment 0.

%%`2/2/1/4%%:offs: Word Offset%%%

The 'offs' field contains a Data Tag Identification, which itself
contains a 64-bit unsigned number which represents the offset into the
referenced Partition, and specified 64-bit address segment.

The segment value refers to one word of the referenced Partition.

The address 0x0000 0000 0000 0000 points to the first word in the
Partition.

An 'offs' field of zero (Data Tag 0x0000) indicates an unreferenced
address. Valid addresses must always be presented in a valid Data Tag
who's identification is not zero.

%%`2/2/1/5%%:unit: Associated Unit%%%

The 'unit' field is optional. A value of zero indicates that there is
no unit associated with the address.

The referenced Unit Tag shall also reference the Address Tag, or else
both are illegal.

Refer to the Unit Tag specification for further information.

%%`2/3%%:Unit Tag%%%

Unit Tags describe a specific region of data within a partition, and
facilitate functional identification of that region, including an
associated "batch" of Commission Tags.

Unit Tags provide a specific region of data which serves as a specific
link-time reference, usually used in the commissioning process, and
generally referenced from Commission Tags, but are also commonly used
in Transfer Slips.

Unit Tags refer to a single, contiguous region within a specific
Partition.

All Address Tags identified in a Unit Tag shall reference that Unit
Tag. All Address Tags which reference a Unit Tag must be explicitly
referenced by the Unit Tag, or are otherwise illegal.

%%`2/3/1%%:Unit Tag Specification%%%

A Unit Tag is a XERIS Standard Ticket with the following fields:

Field    Type      Description
ident	 uint16	   Unit Tag ID

top      uint16	   [Address Tag] Low Word of the unit
bot	     uint16	   [Address Tag] High Word of the unit
com	     uint16	   [Commission Tag] Unit Commission Batch
man	     uint16	   [Human Reference Tag] Human Reference

%%`2/3/1/1%%'ident': Unit Tag Identification%%%

The Unit Tag Identification field is unique for each Unit Tag in a
Registration Package.

Unit Tag 0x0000 is reserved. Its meaning shall always be interpreted
as there being no associated Unit Tag.

Unit Tag 0x0000 shall not exist in a Registration Package. The first
Unit Tag in Registration Package shall have Identification 0x0001.

%%`2/3/1/2%%:'top': Low Word of the unit%%%

The 'top' field contains an Address Tag Identification, which must be
non-zero. The 'top' Address Tag indicates the 'first' word of the
Unit. The 'first' word shall be interpreted as the lowest addressed
word of the Unit.

%%`2/3/1/3%%:'bot': High Word of the unit%%%

The 'bot' field contains an Address Tag Identification. The 'bot'
Address Tag indicates the 'last' word of the Unit. The 'last' word
shall be interpreted as the highest addressed word of the Unit.

An Address Tag Identification of 0x0000 for the 'bot' field indicates
that the unit has an unspecified size, but begins at the address
indicated in 'top'. If the Unit is a single word in size, 'bot' shall
be equal to 'top'.

%%`2/3/1/4%%:'com': Commission Batch%%%

The Commission Batch is the Commission Tag Identification for the
first in a linear vector of commission tags, which shall constitute an
inclusive, contiguous vector of all Commission Tags which use the Unit
as a reference.

Commission tags must always be sorted by referenced unit, though unit
order is arbitrary.

Unit Tags are not required to have Commission Batches assigned. A
Commission Tag Identification of 0x0000 indicates the Unit has no
Commissions. 

%%`2/3/1/5%%:'man': Human Reference%%%

The Human Reference field references a Human Reference Tag, which
provides Human-Friendly referencing information to help identification
of the Unit.

A Human Reference Identification of 0x0000 indicates that there is no
associated Human Reference Tag for the Unit.

%%`2/4%%:Commission Tag%%%

Commission Tags carry information for the registration of new
Secretariats on a target Node. There are a series of generic
Commission Tag types described in this standard, but target- or
implementation-specific tags may extend the features as necessary.

Commission tags generally provided information for the proper
augmentation of referenced instructions such that the physical position
of relevant Partitions are properly accessed. Their meaning is often
dependent on the instruction or data with which they are associated
(via the Endpoint field described below).

A XERIS Standard ATRIA% shall implement all tag types as described in
this specification.

%%`2/4/1%%:Commission Tag Specification%%%

A Commission Tag is a XERIS Standard Ticket with the following fields:

Field    Type      Description
ident    uint16    Tag ID

type     uint16    Commission Tag Type
endp     uint16    Endpoint [Address Tag ID]
ref      uint16    Reference [Unit Tag ID]
annx     uint16    Annex [Data Tag ID]

%%`2/4/1/1%%:ident Field%%%

The Commission Tag Identification field is unique for each Commission
Tag in a Registration Package.

Commission Tag 0x0000 is reserved. Its meaning shall always be
interpreted as


%%`2/4/1/2%%:type Field%%%

The type field carries the Commission Tag type. Types 0000 - 2000 are
reserved for Generic types.

The Generic types are listed as follows:

Value    Code       Description
[Data Operations]
0000     GEN_DDR    Local Dispatch Desk Entry Registration
0001     GEN_TXA    Transaction Account Registration
0002     GEN_MAN    Human Reference Table Root Registration
0003     GEN_ISR    Interrupt Service Registration
0004     GEN_SEC    Initial Security Levels Registration

000f     GEN_MOD    Direct (Anonymous) Modification

0010     GEN_LDR    Register load from working memory
0011     GEN_STR    Register store to working memory 
0012     GEN_LDI    Register load immediate operation
0013     GEN_ROI    Register operation with immediate
0014     GEN_STI    Memory store immediate operation
0015     GEN_LDM    Memory load operand (memory-memory ops)
0016     GEN_STM    Memory save operand
0017     GEN_TAM    Memory tertiary/accumulator operand

[Control Operations]
1000     GEN_SYS    XERIS Call
1001     GEN_JMP    Control Transfer Operation (jump/call)
1002     GEN_REL    Relative Control Transfer Operation (PC relative)
1003     GEN_IND    Indirect Control Transfer

%%`2/1/1/3%%:Endpoint Field%%%

The Endpoint Field is a Tag ID of an Address Tag which points to the
first addressable unit of the associated instruction. The Endpoint
must refer to an Address in the Executive Partition only.

%%`2/1/1/4%%:Reference Field%%%

The Reference Field is a Tag ID of an Identification Tag, which
provides the relevant identification information for the reference to
which the operation refers.

The Reference Field represents a Unit Tag Identification, which
indicates a specific region or address in the same or other
partition. The Reference Field may hold Unit Tag Identification
0x0000, which indicates there is no reference related to the
modification. Typically, this means an addend would be applied.

For example: A GEN_LDR type could reference an appropriate object in
the working memory space, for which the register load instruction must
reference statically. The unit tag could identify a region or address
in one of the Operational Partitions, who's location is decided by the
the commissioning node. generalized working memory "symbol" which could
be globally referenced during commissioning.

%%`2/1/1/5%%:Annex Field%%%

The Annex field provides static data required to make the appropriate
adjustment to the endpoint. For example, this could be an index value
relative to the reference field, an immediate value, or an offset (such
as for a relative control transfer)

The specific use of the Annex feild depends on the Commission Tag
type.


%%`2/5%%:Data Tag%%%

A Data Tag contains a fixed 64-bit word of data. It's interpretation
is application-specific. However, there exists three specifically
reserved Data Tags, of identifications 0x0000 - 0x0002. These
specifically reserved Data Tags are described later in this section.


%%`2/5/1%%:Data Tag Specification%%%

Field    Type      Description
ident    uint16    Tag ID

data     (uint64)  Payload


%%`2/5/1/1%%:ident Field%%%

The Data Tag Identification field is unique for each Data Tag in a
Registration Package.

Data Tag Identification 0x0000 is reserved for the Bit/Word Order
Test. This Tag cannot be referenced by any other Tag, and can only be
requested directly. If any tag references Data Tag Identification
0x0000, this shall always be taken to mean there is no associated Data
Tag.


%%`2/5/1/1/1%%:Data Tag 0x0000 - Bit/Word Order Test%%%

The Bit/Word Order Test Data Tag, of Identification 0x0000, shall
always contain a static value which always equals an unsigned, 64-bit
integer with the value 0xFEDCBA9876543210. The tag shall always be
stored and transmitted in identical fashion as all other tags.

This allows any party to identify the bit/word ordering used to store
or transmit the package.

%%`2/5/1/2%%:data Field - Data payload%%%

The data Feild contains the referenced data in a standard XERIS ticket
encoded format.

%%`2/6%%:Human Reference Tag%%%

A Human Reference Tag provides a simple human-readable name or
description for Unit Tags. It always references a first and last index
into the Human Reference Partition. This is always a linear octet
offset into the partition.

The referenced strings shall be in UTF-8 encoding. 

The referenced strings shall never be assumed terminated by any means
except the bounds provided by the 'first' and 'last' fields.

%%`2/5/1%%:Human Reference Tag Specification%%%

Field    Type      Description
ident    uint16    Tag ID

first    unit32    First octet
last     unit32    Last octet

%%`2/5/1%%:ident Field - Tag Identification Number%%%

The Human Reference Tag Identification field is unique for each Data
Tag in a Registration Package.

Human Reference Tag Identification 0x0000 is reserved and shall not be
valid. When referenced from a Unit Tag, it shall indicate that there
is no Human Reference Tag associated with that Unit Tag.

%%`3%%:Package Tags%%%

Package Tags are specified Tags which have universal interpretation
and use in any XERIS/APEX Secretariat Registration Package.

This section describes all Package Tag specifications for this version
of the XERIS/APEX system.

%%`3/1%%:Resource Tags%%

Resource Tags specify the required and assumed memory resources needed
for the registration of the packaged secretariat on the target node.

The Resource Tags are roughly analogous to "sections" in some binary
formats, but allow for further abstraction. The abstraction allows the
XERIS/APEX Secretariat Registration Package Standard to be
architecture agnostic. Hardware-specific architecture can be
represented as needed through these abstract resource tags.

Resource Tags delineate contiguous regions of address space which must
be static at the time of registration. ATRIA will make the appropriate
reservations in the actual address space.

Resource Tags occupy Tag IDs 0000 - 000f. Resource Tags are always
Address Tags. Resource Tag 0000 - 0002 are not optional.

Resource Tag 0000 specifically references the entire instruction data
space. This is analogous to a "text" section. The extents need not
necessarily define the extent of instructions, and may contain any
data. For non-harvard architectures, this may be the only dataspace.

Resource Tag 0001 specifically references the working memory (RAM)
required by the 


%%`3%%:Transfer Slip Ticket Description%%%

A Transfer Slip Ticket is a XERIS/APEX Standard Ticket that allows for
bi-directional, and reliable raw Partition data transfer between
XERIS/APEX Nodes/Secretariats.

Correct usage of Transfer Slips requires use of the dispatch
work-board to transfer bulk data. The logistics are the responsibility
of the ATRIA interfacing secretariat. The only requirement is that a
transfer must always be an integral multiple of words.

%%`3/1%%:Transfer Slip Ticket Specification%%%

A Transfer Slip XERIS Standard Ticket with the following fields:

Field    Type      Description
unit     uint16    Unit Tag ID

seq      uint32    Block Sequence
bsz      uint32    Block size (words)

%%`3/1/1%%:unit - Unit Tag ID%%%

The Unit Tag ID indicates the related unit
