%%!l/2000%track%%:Track Registrar%%%

%%`0%%:Synopsis%%%

The Track Registrar provides a simple, node-local facility for
establishing and coordinating session streams among various
secretariats on the node.

Tracks are defined simply with an Administrator and an Agent. The
Administrator leases a track, and the Agent represents the active
endpoint of the track.

The Track Registrar has a single desk, and accepts submission to any
desk ID. The Track Registrar accepts only track tickets.

Any other ticket type will automatically result in a XERIS Standard
Report Ticket with a RJT stub, and SOSES code of OP-F-UNACPT_ORDER
(0000/5008).

%%`1%%:Track Query (xst_trak ticket)%%%

A Track Query is a request to "fill-out" a Track Waybill according to
the provided Track ID. Only the Track Administrator of Record or Agent
of Record may query a track. Queries on non-existent or disassociated
tracks will be rejected.

%%`1/1%%:Submission Procedure%%%

xst_trak expectations:

Field           Value
track           Track ID of Query
dispatch        Ignored
sid             Ignored
dsk             Ignored

If the query is accepted, l/track% will return a Track Waybill. If the
Query source is the Track Administrator, the SID/DSK pair will
indicate the Agent of Record. If the query source is the Agent, the
SID/DSK pair will indicate the Administrator of Record.

%%`1/1%%:Return Conditions%%%

If the query request is successful, l/track% will return a Track Waybill
in the appropriate direction.

If the query request is not successful, l/track% will return a XERIS
Standard report ticket with the relevant Stub class, indicating the
offending condition.

If there is no Agent of Record (Agent has dropped the track), l/track%
will return a XERIS Standard Report Ticket with a DNY Stub. This
generally indicates the previous Agent of Record has dropped the track
via the appropriate Track Administration Request. The Administrator of
Record may then register a new Agent of Record, transfer the lease, or
terminate the lease.
