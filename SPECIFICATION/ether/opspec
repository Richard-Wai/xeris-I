%%:ETHER% Eminent Tier Horizon Executive Relay%%%

%%`0%%:Role of ETHER in the XERIS/APEX System%%%

ETHER acts as an executive agent of the Executive Group. The role of
ETHER% is to bridge the gap between the local Tier Horizon, and the
supporting internal and trans-tier operations.

In simple terms, ETHER% dispatches tickets in service of the Tier
Horizon Dictate, often under the direction of a Supreme Directorate
Liaison.

The implementation of ETHER% is intended to be as undefined as
possible, to afford the necessary flexibility.

The basic operational intention is for ETHER% to act as a gateway for
elevated privileges, as well as the organized execution and reporting
of Tier Horizon Dictate directives.

%%`1/0%%:0000$ Ticket Export Operator (TEX$)%%%

The export operator accepts only XERIS Standard Report tickets for
export. Upon receipt of a telemetry ticket, ETHER will re-format the
ticket into a XERIS Standard Telemetry ticket, and export it to the
assigned export agent.

TEX$ will always return with a XERIS Standard Report ticket which will
always be one of two possible configurations:

STUB    SPEC   CODE      Human Format
ACP     0000   0009      OP-S-ACCEPTED
RJT     0000   5008      OP-F-UNACPT_ORDER

%%`1/1%%:0001$ Configuration Operator (CFG$)%%%

When invoked, the configuration operator always directly invokes
FLATLINE%ECM$ (ETHER Configuration Manager) and provides a pointer to
the configuration file directly to FLATLINE%ECM$. ECM$ can also
configure ETHER$ to reject all further CFG$ requests.

CFG$ is primarily intended to be invoked from FLATLINE%$.

CFG$ will return a XERIS Standard Report Ticket, referencing SOSES
Spec 0000, in one of two possible configurations:

Stub      SOSES Code          Description
CPL       OP-S-REQUEST_CPL    Request relayed to ETHER$CFG$
UNA       OP-S-OPR_UNAVAIL    Operator is disabled

%%`2%%: ETHER Configuration File%%%

The ether configuration file a few simple configuration details as
follows:

Element     Type      Description
sid         uint16    Secretariat ID of line operator
opr         uint16    Operator ID of line operator
cfg         uint8     Config Flags

Config flags:
Bit    Code     Default   Description (when set)
0      CF_TLM   SET       ETHER% only accepts Telemetry Tickets
1      CF_CFG   SET       ETHER%CFG$ accessible
2      CF_ENA   SET       ETHER%EXP$ service enabled
3      CF_HEX   CLEAR     Only applies if line operator is FLATLINE%ULO$
                          non-telemetry reports are passed to ULO$ to be
                          encoded in a human-readable HEX stream.
