%%`0%%:Role of SIPLEX% in the XERIS/APEX System%%%

SIPLEX provides a core, but intentionally simply-defined role in the
XERIS/APEX system.

The core role of SIPLEX is to maintain the insertion, removal, and
general house-keeping of the system's active Dispatches. SIPLEX%
provides high-level support to OPSEC% by managing long-term queued and
cyclic tasks, and also manages the executive areas, including the
provisions of zones, case files, supervisor files, and dispatch files.

SIPLEX% takes an active role in directing OPSEC%, and offers
relatively few external services. For this reason the specified
behavior of SIPLEX includes only a very minimal interface, and
equally minimal set of core services, via two specified Operators.

Such a design allows for the internal operation of SIPLEX, as well as
additional command and control interfaces to be implemented separately,
facilitating vastly different levels of system complexity.

One particular expected use-case of SIPLEX% would include general
language run-times, and particularly multi-threaded
run-times. Following the over-all XERIS philosophy, in such a case, a
single "process" or program would occupy an entire node, with the
run-time tasking (multi-threading) handled by the SIPLEX
implementation for that application.

%%`1%%:SIPLEX% Standard Interface%%%

The SIPLEX% standard interface consists of two specified operators:

Operator ID      Name        Description
0000$            SUB$        Shot submission operator
ffff$            SYS$        SIPLEX Configuration interface

Any other submissions will result in and XERIS Standard Report with
one of three possible errors:
 
OP-F-NO_OPERATOR    - Operator does not exist
OP-F-UNACPT_ORDER   - Work order is not a XERIS Standard Service Request
OP-F_SVC_UNAVAIL    - Service request number is invalid
OP-F_ACCESS_DENIED  - Privilege not sufficient

Of those request tickets, only three Service Codes are specified:

SVC     Name       Description
0000    LEAS       Leased shot submission
0001    PRIV       Private shot submission
0002    CANC       Cancel shot submission

%%`1/0%% SUB$LEAS# - Leased Shot Submission%%%

Leased shot submissions are intended for triggers, events, or cyclics
where the result is of no interest. After a leased shot has fired, it
is returned immediately to the free pool and made available for
others. SIPLEX% never provides direct references to the public shot
pool. Therefore successful lease submissions do not provide any internal
means for result collection. However, the system can be configured to
generate telemetry for all shot returns.

To request a leased shot submission, first attach a local XERIS
Dispatch Case File to the Case File Board, and ensure the Board Size
is set correctly. Next, attach a XERIS Standard Service Request Ticket
to the Case File with the parameter fields filled-out as follows:

.p16:

0:   Contractor (recipient) SID
1:   Shot intent code (XERIS Standard Shot Intent)
2:   Dispatch permit
3:   N/A

SIPLEX% will make a copy of the submission Case File and assign it to
a new shot, if a public shot is available.  In the case of a
successful submission, SUB# will return a XERIS Standard Report Ticket
with the following configuration:

stub:       ACP
code:       OP-S-ACCEPTED
condition:  OKY
note:       NON

For unsuccessful attempts, the following errors are possible:

Stub   SOSES                  Meaning
RJT    OP-F-PARAM_EXCUR       Shot intent is invalid
RJT    OP-F-NOT_PERMITTED     Requested intent was not approved
RJT    OP-F-CB_CONFIG         Case File Board has invalid configuration
UNA    OP-F-INSUF_RESRC       No available public shots at this moment

%%`1/0%% SUB$PRIV# - Private Shot Submission%%%

Private shots are intended for cases where a desire for non-blocking
work be done in background or deferred, but where the result is of
interest. In cases such as this, a properly authorized Secretariat may
submit "private" shots by providing a reference to a privately stored
Shotcard. SIPLEX% checks, and will only accept, Shotcards that are
within the Secretariat's Operational Partitions. Shotcards may not be
submitted from the stack.

SIPLEX% does not ensure or check for mutual exclusion of private
Shotcards. It is the responsibility of the owning Secretariat to
ensure private Shotcards are not submitted simultaneously.

It is generally recommended that SIPLEX$ be registered with a very
high (or maximum) Upstream Security Level. It is not generally
envisioned that SIPLEX% be directly accessed on a general
basis. Dispatch submissions, public or private, are recommended to be
submitted exclusively via the appropriate Facility Group Secretariats,
namely f/cyc%, f/cmd%, and f/batch%.

To request a private shot submission, first attach the subject Shotcard
to the Case File Board, and ensure the Board Size is set correctly.
Next, attach a XERIS Standard Service Request Ticket. This ticket has no
particular parameter fields.

SIPLEX% will attempt to load the Shotcard into a free "sabot" from a
public queue. In the case of a successful load, SUB# will return a
XERIS Standard Report Ticket with the following configuration:

stub:       ACP
code:       OP-S-ACCEPTED
condition:  OKY
note:       REF
adi32:      Submission reference (used to cancel)

The Shotcard status may be read at any time, but the Shotcard shall
never be written to (including the status) until the Shotcard is
unloaded (status becomes "UNL"). Once a private Shotcard in unloaded,
it is ejected from the system entirely, and becomes fully accessible
to the owner.

SIPLEX% unloads a private shot whenever it completes, or is canceled.

For unsuccessful attempts, the following errors are possible:

stub: RJT

Code Meaning OP-F-PARAM_EXCUR Shot intent is invalid
OP-F-NOT_PERMITTED Access level is insufficient to use this service
OP-F-CB_CONFIG Case File Board has invalid configuration
OP-F-INSUF_RESRC No available "sabots" at this moment
