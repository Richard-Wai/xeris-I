%%!0004%init%%:Node Initialization Bootstrap%%%

%%`0%%:Synopsis%%%

The Node Initialization Bootstrap (init%) is always the first shot
loaded by SIPLEX% after it has initialized all lanes. The genertic
form for init% follows a "strap" that is defined in the local ATRIA
Secretariat Registrar. The node init strap is rebuilt during
registration of complient secretariats.

%%`1%%:Mode of operation%%%


%%`1/1%%:Simple Initialization%%%

For each Secretariat on the strap, there is a two-phase process. The
first phase is initiated with an "INI" stub Work Order sent to desk
0000$ of the target Secretariat. The Case Board is guaranteed to be
clear.

If no config block is requred, the secretariat shall return a Word
Order with the following configuration:

Stub:    CPL
Ticket:  XERIS Standard Report Ticket
Spec:    OP
Code:    OP-I-INIT_OK

If any other stub or ticket configuration is received, the
initialization will be assumed to have failed. 

If the receiving secretariat wishes to load a configuration block,
they must return from the first phase with the Case Board set properly
to receive the configuration file, and then configure the Work Order
with exactly the following configuration:


Stub:    PAR
Ticket:  XERIS Standard Report Ticket
spec:    OP
code:    OP-I-INIT_CONFIG
cond:    RTY
note:    NON
