%%!f/1005%rdc%%:Recurrent Dispatch Commission%%%

%%`0%%:Synopsis%%%

The Recurrent Dispatch Commission is a public facility for the
registration of recurrent "polling"-type event triggers that are
cyclically, and repetitively triggered over an indefinite period.

The generic implementation is quite flexible and scalable, however a
simple interface allows the module to be easily customized.

%%`0/1%%:Operational Overview%%%

Secretariats may submit a custom event ticket to rdc% apply for
registration. If registration is successful, the ticket will be
entered into the dispatch FIFO queue.

One or more cyclic shotcards registered by rdc% attempt to release one
dispatch from the dispatch queue at each run. The released event ticket
is copied to a new public shotcard with rdc% as the client, and entered
onto a command queue.

Upon return, the registrant may "confirm" the event to have it
re-entered onto the dispatch queue. Otherwise, the dispatch is freed.

It is intended that the action triggered by a rdc% event dispatch is
for simple polling operations, and that any ultimate action therein
undertaken be done so by submitting a separate shotcard, and then
releasing or confirming the event card separately.

rdc% is capable of running multiple agents on different cyclic queues
to prevent any blocking actions. All agents pull from the same
dispatch queue. 

%%`0/1%%:Desk Summary%%%

Desk    HRT Symbol      Description
0000    sub$            Submission desk
0001    ctl$            Control desk

(Internal Desks)
0002    agt$            Dispatch Agency
0003    txp$            Transaction Reception
0004    txe$            Transaction Executive

The internal desks are not accessible externally. Attempts to do so
always result in a rejection

%%`1%%:sub$ - Submission Desk%%%

%%`1/0%%:Submission Procedure%%%

The submission desk accepts new registration requests for entry onto
the Recurrent Dispatch Queue. sub$ only accepts XERIS Standard Event
tickets with a "EVT" Stub. Any other submissions will be rejected.

rdc% will save a copy of the Event Ticket in it's submitted form,
except for the "sid" field, which will be automatically over-written
with the registrant's SID. Upon dispatch from rdc%, this event ticket
will be dispatched as submitted, to the indicated desk of the
registrant. rdc% does not increment the sequence number.

%%`1/1%%:Possible Submission Returns%%%

sub$ will only ever return XERIS Standard Report Tickets of the
following possible configurations:

Stub   SOSES               Description
ACP    OP-S-ACCPTED        Trigger has been entered into the queue
UNA    OP-F-INSUF_RESRC    No more available slots in the queue
UNA    OP-I-INIT_REQUIRED  RDC has not been initialized
RJT    OP-F-UNACPT_ORDER   Submission is not an event ticket

%%`1/2%%:Confirmation and Cancellation%%%

rdc% will eventually submit a queued dispatch as a CMD shotcard to an
rdc% dispatch agent. The agent then forwards the event ticket to the
registrant. When a dispatch is released, it is removed from the
dispatch queue and held in a confirmation queue until the event is
confirmed or canceled by the agent.

%%`1/2/1%%:Confirmation%%%

Confirmation is achieved by returning a XERIS Standard Event Ticket
with the same "sid" field as the original event. If such a return is
received, the dispatch ticket will be updated with the returned "dsk",
"ref", and "seq" values, allowing for conditional routing within the
registrant. If the dispatch is confirmed, it will be placed back into
the dispatch queue.

%%`1/2/2%%:Cancellation%%%

If the dispatch agent receives a return that does not meet the
criteria for confirmation, the dispatch is canceled.

%%`2%%:ctl$ - Control Desk%%%

%%`2/0%%:Submission Procedure%%%

The Designated Controller may submit a relevant XERIS Standard Service
Request ticket to set a new value for the relevant configuration
register, or alternately execute a management action.

Submissions to the Control Desk from Secretariats that are not the
Designated Controller are denied. Submissions from the Designated
Controller that are not XERIS Standard Service Request Tickets are
rejected.

Unless otherwise customized, the default controller shall be 0004%STRAP.

%%`2/1%%:Management Actions%%%

SVC    HRT Selector     Description
0000   INIT&            Initialize queues
0001   AGENT&           Register new agent
0002   CTRL&            Set Controller SID

%%`2/1/0%%:INIT& - Initialize Queues%%%

The INIT& service request does not take any parameters. This service
request will cause rdc% to initialize all queues. This service cannot
be invoked more than once after the FLATLINE event.

It is recommended that INIT& must be invoked for rdc% services to be
made available.

%%`2/1/0/1%%:Possible Results for INIT& submissions%%%

Stub   SOSES               Description
CPL    OP-I-INIT_OK        Init completed successfully
RJT    OP-I-INIT_ILLEGAL   Init completed prior

%%`2/1/1%%:AGENT& - Register new agent%%%

AGENT& instructs rdc% to attempt to register a new cyclic shotcard
with SIPLEX%. A permit may also be passed as an parameter to register
the shotcard on non-mainline queues.

%%`2/1/1/1%%:Parameters%%%

Parameter    Type      Description
p16[0]       uint16    Permit number

%%`2/1/1/2%%:Possible Results for AGENT& submissions%%%

Stub   SOSES               Description
CPL    OP-S-OPR_OK         SIPLEX% Accepted the shotcard submission
UNA    OP-F-INSUF_RESRC    SIPLEX% could not provide a free shot
RJT    OP-F-NOT_PERMITTED  SIPLEX% rejected the permit
DNY    OP-F-NO_AUTH        Insufficient security level to submit shotcard

%%`2/1/2%%:CTRL& - Set Controller SID%%%

The CTRL& service request configures the SID of the Designated
Controller. The default Designated Controller post-FLATLINE is STRAP%
(0004%)

%%`2/1/2/1%%:Parameters%%%

Parameter    Type      Description
p16[0]       uint16    Designated Controller SID
