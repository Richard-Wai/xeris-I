%%:String to Integer Conversion Desk%%%

%%`0%%:Description%%%

The MAN% Integer to String Conversion Desk (man%atoi$) accepts a
32-bit max signed or unsigned integer in human-readable UTF-8 format,
to be converted into a 32-bit signed or unsigned integer value.

%%`1%%:Submission Procedure%%%

atoi$ accepts only XERIS Standard Service Requests Tickets. Tickets of
other types will be rejected.

atoi$ expects a suitable buffer to be attached to the Case Board.

atoi$ will only process the characters up to the first null character
encountered, or the end of the buffer, whichever comes first. atoi$
ignores spaces ' ', and commas ',', but encountering any other value
causes atoi$ to end the conversion process. If the service code
indicates a signed value, and the first character is a '-', it is
ignored. For any signed value, the sign shall always be the first
character of the buffer, or the value will be interpreted as being
positive.

The Service Request Code indicates two conditions. The high byte
indicates if the input value is signed (1) or unsigned (0). The low
byte indicates the radix of the input, according to the following
table:

Value   Code    Radix
00      HEX     16
01      DEC     10
02      OCT     08
03      BIN     02

For example:

Request Code      Expected Input
0000              Unsigned Hexadecimal
0101              Signed Decimal

The target value for conversion shall be passed as prm32[0].

%%`2%%:Possible Returns%%%

atoi$ will always return a XERIS Standard Report Ticket with the
following possible outcomes:
