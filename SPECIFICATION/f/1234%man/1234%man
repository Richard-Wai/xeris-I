%%`0%%:Operational Summary%%%

The Human Relations Secretariat provides a large number of diverse
services to support human interaction with the XERIS/APEX system. The
primary role of the Human Relations Secretariat is to provide human
translation and reference services for the navigation of the various
index-based XERIS/APEX features, such as Secretariats, Desks, and
SOSES/telemetry code sets.

Additionally, MAN% provides basic support services for enabling human
interaction, such as human-readable encoding and decoding services.

MAN% is not intended for direct human interaction, and rather provides
a suite of services to enable other human-focused user packages. This
modular approach allows MAN% to be implemented in a distributed or
Tier-span configurations, or simply as part of externally interfaced
temporary maintenance node devices.
