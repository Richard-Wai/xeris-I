%%:Telemetry Translation Unit Desk%%%

%%`0%%:Description%%%

The MAN% Telemetry Translation Unit produces the specified Telemetry
Human Translation as specified in the SOSES specification for the
relevant SPEC/CODE pair.

%%`1%%:Submission Procedure%%%

The ttu$ desk only accepts XERIS Standard Telemetry Tickets. Tickets
of other types are simply ignored.

ttu$ will first pass the received telemetry to an internal
specification look-up module, which will attempt to reconcile and
process the Human Format as described in the code specification. If no
code is found, ttu$ will instead pass the telemetry to the
Human-Readable Encoding module to generate a generic encoded telemetry
string.

ttu$ expects the Case Board to be configured as a buffer with a
minimum size of 81 characters (uint8). ttu$ will write the result of
the translation directly to the buffer. In the case that there is no
code available, ttu$ will pass the Case File directly to stu$.

All human-readable exports from man% are always encoded in raw UTF-8.

%%`2%%:Possible Returns%%%

ttu$ will always return a XERIS Standard Report Ticket with the
following possible outcomes:

Stub    SOSES Code          Description
CPL     OP-S-REQUEST_CPL    Request was completed as filed
PAR     OP-S-REQUEST_CPL    Request was processed by stu$
RJT     OP-F-CB_CONFIG      Case Board configuration unacceptable
