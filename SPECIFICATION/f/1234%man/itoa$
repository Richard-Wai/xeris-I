%%:Integer to String Conversion Desk%%%

%%`0%%:Description%%%

The MAN% Integer to String Conversion Desk (man%itoa$) accepts a
32-bit signed or unsigned integer to be converted into Human-readable
text of an indicated base (2, 8, 10, 16).

%%`1%%:Submission Procedure%%%

itoa$ accepts only XERIS Standard Service Requests Tickets. Tickets of
other types will be rejected.

itoa$ expects a suitable buffer to be attached to the Case Board. The
Case Board size must be at least 34 bytes.

itoa$ will reference the Case Board attached buffer to determine any
digit restriction. To indicate a digit minimum or restriction, the
buffer should be written with UTF-8 '0' characters. If itoa$ finds a
'0' character at the beginning of the buffer, it will only write
digits to the contiguous string of '0' characters found at the
beginning of the buffer.

For example, assuming an input of "12456789" (radix 10):

Initial Buffer                Final buffer
"bkjq2e334lkn34af\0"          "123456789\0kn34af\0"
"000q2e334lkn32af\0"          "123\02e334lkn32af\0"
"0000000000000000\0"          "0000000123456789\0"

The Service Request Code indicates two conditions. The high byte
indicates if the input value is signed (1) or unsigned (0). The low
byte indicates the radix of the output, according to the following
table:

Value   Code    Radix
00      HEX     16
01      DEC     10
02      OCT     08
03      BIN     02

For example:

Request Code      Conversion Result
0000              Unsigned Hexadecimal
0101              Signed Decimal

The target value for conversion shall be passed as prm32[0].
