%%:SOSES Translation Unit Desk%%%

%%`0%%:Description%%%

The MAN% SOSES Translation Unit produces the specified Human
Translation as specified in the SOSES specification for the relevant
SPEC/CODE pair.

%%`1%%:Submission Procedure%%%

The stu$ desk only accepts XERIS Standard Report or Telemetry
Tickets. Tickets of other types are simply ignored.

If no valid spec/code translation entry is available, stu$ will encode
the spec/code pair and adi/datagram as per the XSRES (xeris?xsres*)
specification. In case of report tickets, the indicated source SID is
extracted from the Case File Stamp. 

stu$ expects the Case Board to be configured as a buffer with a
minimum size of 83 octets (uint8). If the case board is ever found
to be insufficient for the output string, stu will write a null
character at location pointed to by the case board pointer.

All human-readable exports from man% are always encoded in UTF-8.

stu$ will not modify the Active Case File in any way, except for the
Case Board as described above.
