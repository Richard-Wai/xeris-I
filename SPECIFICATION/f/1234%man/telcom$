%%:MAN% Telemetry Commissioner%%%

%%`1%%:Synopsis%%%

MAN%TELCOM$ is a fully complaint Telemetry Commissioner, and can be
assigned directly in OPCON. MAN%TC$ attempts to translate received
Telemetry into the specified "Human format", and directly outputs the
decoded telemetry to the configured console.

%%`1%%:Submission Procedure%%%

MAN%TELCCOM$ only accepts XERIS Standard Telemetry and Service Request
tickets. Service Request tickets are screened against a configured
minimum security level. If the incoming downstream security level as
stamped on the Case File is insufficient, TC$ treats the submission as
a regular "invalid" ticket.

Tickets that are not Telemetry tickets, or are otherwise invalid, are
ignored.

Telemetry tickets are processed and exported to the console driver.

TELCOM$ never makes any modifications to the Active Case File, as per
the Telemetry Commissioner specification. This applies even during
configuration operations.

%%`2%%:Configuration Procedure%%%

Service Request Tickets received that are meet or exceed the
downstream security level requirement affect the configuration
parameter as listed below. The Service Request parameter fields shall
be filled according to the configuration parameter size as indicated
in the following table:
