%%:Tier Horizon Export%%%

%%`0%%:Description%%%

The Tier Horizon Export works as the downstream commissioned processor
(DCP) for l/horizon%, processing the Active Case File into, a
standardized human-readable plain-text (UTF-8) encoding.

The standard encoding format is also specified by this specification.

%%`1%%:Tier Horizon Interface Encoding Specification%%%

Transmitted data shall be encoded numerically in Hexadecimal using
UTF-8, capital letters A-F, and digits 0-9. Nibbles shall be
transmitted serially, and in "big-endian" order.

The space (' ') character shall be ignored and serves no functional
significance, however it shall be inserted during the encoding phase
to separate contiguous blocks of four bytes (4 nibbles/digits).

Sections of the case file shall be delineated at both start and end by
appropriate symbols as defined in this specification.

A Case File transmission encoding shall itself be delineated by an
appropriate signature at the beginning and end, and shall be
transmitted contiguously.

%%`1/1%%:Case File Transmission Begin Signature%%%

A new Case File Transmission shall begin with the following signature:

"!HORIZON/"

%%`1/2%%:Board Delineation%%%

Case Board Pointer Begin: "*"
Case Board Size Begin: "+"
Section Termination: "/"

Board pointer shall always show all digits of the node pointer size to
communicate the pointer width. Board size has no such constraint.

%%`1/3%%:Work Order Delineation%%%

Work Order Desk Termination: "$"
Work Order Stub Termination: "["
Section Termination        : "]"

%%`1/4%%:Stamp Delineation%%%

SID Termination                      : "%"
Upstream Desk Termination            : "$"
Downstream Security level Termination: "?"

%%`1/5%%:Encoding Example%%%

In this encoding example, the source node has a pointer width of 16
bits, and is returning a XERIS Standard Report Ticket to the tier
horizon via a call to xeris ( 0 ). The report is SOSES code
OP-S-REQUEST_CPL, with a CPL stub, a condition NRM and, note NON, and
random adi on the ticket. The board pointer is null with a random
board size.

Originating Secretariat is %6012, and f/man%tci$ (1234%8000$) is the
Telemetry Commissioner.

The output stream from thex$ will be as follows:

"!HORIZON*0000+50/8000$[0000 0002 0000 A2F8 10AC]6012%0$1000?"

%%`1%%:Submission Procedure%%%

The thex$ desk is ticket agnostic, and will pack any ticket. 

thex$ will not modify the Active Case File in any way.
