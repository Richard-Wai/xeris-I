%%!s/0014%txc%%:Ticket Exchange Secretariat%%%

%%`0%%:Synopsis%%%

The Ticket Exchange Secretariat exchanges a ticket pointed to by the
Case Board Pointer with the ticket associated with the Active Case
File. The exchange may be executed in one of three modes: Swap
(swap$), Copy (copy$), or Put (put$). 

%%`1%%:Operational Procedure%%%

The Ticket Swap Secretariat expects a valid XERIS
Standard/Non-standard Ticket pointer to be passed in the active Case
File Board Pointer, with the Board Size set appropriately.

The desk must be set according to the intended exchange mode. An
invalid desk will cause the operation to fail.

Desk ID    HRT Name     Operation
0000       swap$        Swap
0001       copy$        Copy
0002       put$         Put

%%`1/0%%:Swap operation%%%

Swap operations are commanded by submitting to the swap$ desk.

A swap operation is implemented as a sequential Copy operation, to a
temporary ticket, followed by a Put operation, from the Case Board
Pointer referenced ticket to the Case Board Work Order, followed
finally by a Put operation from the temporary ticket to the Case Board
Pointer referenced ticket. This order is compulsory for adherence to
this specification.

The Case File Word Order Stub is not set.

%%`1/1%%:Copy operation%%%

Copy operations are commanded by submitting to the copy$ desk.

A Copy operation copies the Case File Work Order ticket to the Case
Board Pointer referenced ticket.

%%`1/2%%:Put operation%%%

Put operations are commanded by submitting to the put$ desk.

A Put operation copies the Case Board Pointer referenced ticket to the
Case File Work Order ticket.

The Case File Word Order Stub is not set.

%%`2%%:Possible Failure Modes%%%

If the operation is not successful, impossible, not authorized, or
incorrect for any reason, s/swp% will clear the Active Case Board,
posting a NULL pointer, and setting the size to NIL.
