%%!s/0010%rsv%%:Case File Reserve%%%

%%`0%%:Synopsis%%%

The Case File Reserve Secretariat allows efficient and reliable storage
of the work-order section of the active case file to a referenced
alternate file. The board is not saved, and is not modified during
write-out to the reference file.

The Case File Reserve Secretariat is Operator agnostic, and provides a
simple single interface.

This specification describes the use of and operation of s/rsv%.

%%`1%%:Operational Procedure%%%

It should be noted that under no circumstances whatsoever does r/rsv%
modify the work order of the Active Case File.

The Case File Reserve Secretariat expects a valid XERIS Standard Case
File pointer to be passed in the active Case File Board Pointer, with
the Board Size set appropriately.

Assuming a correct submission, the Case File Reserve Secretariat will
transfer the complete Work Order as-is to the Alternate Case File
posted to the Active Case Board. s/rsv% will not modify the Alternate
Case Board in the process. In the case of a correct submission, s/rsv%
will not make any modifications to the Active Case File

%%`2%%:Possible Failure Modes%%%

If the operation is not successful, impossible, or incorrect for any
reason, s/rsv% will clear the Active Case Board, posting a NULL
pointer, and setting the size to NIL.

The most likely cause of an unsuccessful operation is an incorrect
submission. An incorrect submission includes 1) an invalid pointer
(out of bounds or unauthorized), or 2) an incorrect size indication.
