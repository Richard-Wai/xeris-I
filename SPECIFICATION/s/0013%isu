%%!s/0011%isu%%:Case File Issue%%%

%%`0%%:Synopsis%%%

The Case File Issue Secretariat allows efficient and reliable
filling-out of the Active Case File from a referenced alternate
file. In this operation, unlike the similar s/rsv%, also copies out
the Case Board in it's entirety. s/isu% will copy out the complete
alternate Case File to the Active Case File in it's absolute entirety.

The Case File Issue Secretariat is Operator agnostic, and provides a
simple single interface.

This specification describes the use of and operation of s/isu%.

%%`1%%:Operational Procedure%%%

The Case File Issue Secretariat expects a valid XERIS Standard Case
File pointer to be passed in the active Case File Board Pointer, with
the Board Size set appropriately.

Assuming a correct submission, the Case File Issue Secretariat will
copy-out the entire alternate Case File, including the board
configuration, to the Active Case File.

%%`2%%:Possible Failure Modes%%%

If the operation is not successful, impossible, or incorrect for any
reason, s/isu% will clear the Active Case Board, posting a NULL
pointer, and setting the size to NIL.
