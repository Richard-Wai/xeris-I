%%*X3S%%:XERIS Specification Stream Standard%%.0%%,1%%%

%%`1%%:SYNOPSIS%%%

XERIS/APEX is a fundamentally specified system. As such, this master
specification lays-out the basic specification for the specification
system itself and framework. Though there need-not be any centralized
specification for all of XERIS/APEX and derivatives, this
implementation allows for a universal format and machine-readable
processing procedures.

The XERIS/APEX Specification does not specify a common data format or
storage message. The data may be transmitted and stored any way deemed
appropriate. The only requirement is that the transmission always be a
sequential stream.

%%`%%:Bursts%%%

Specification streams are fundamentally divided into a series of
"bursts", which are the actual content of the specification, delinted
with a string of BUST DELINEATORs.

%%`/%%:Burst Delineation%%%

Specification data in a steam are assigned to appropriate
PARTITION/ELEMENT/SECTIONS in a package with BURST DELINEATORS. BURST
DELINEATORs are indicated with two consecutive '%' symbols, followed by
a single classifier symbol. The classifier symbol indicates a
delineation class, and is followed immediately by the associated data
for that delineation. Data is confined by the next BURST DELINEATOR or
by a null delineator (three consecutive '%' symbols). The classifier
'\' always resolves directly to a '%' in the steam. That is to say
"%%\%%\\" is replaced by '%%\' in the steam, and is otherwise not
considered to be a BURST DELINEATOR.

BURST DELINEATORs have a primary and secondary function. The primary
function is to define PACKAGE,PARTITION,ELEMENT, and SECTION of a
given burst. The secondary function is to provide descriptive
information such as element identification, description, revision
number, section number, and many others, as described in this
specification.


%%`%%:Partitions%%%

Specifications must have an associated package. Packages may be
collapsed by the system, but all specifications must identify a
package. Package names are not case-sensitive. The package 'xeris' is
reserved for the core XERIS/APEX Release Specification. A package is
devided into two PARTITIONs: STANDARDS (?) and OPERATION (!).

Each PARTITION consists of a hierarchical set of ELEMENTS in a
hierarchical tree of that mimics the Human Reference Notation
Specification (HRNS) as implemented by the XERIS/APEX Core/Human
Affairs Secretariat (see xeris?man%hrns`). An ELEMENT represents a
single descriptive or operational component specification unit. An
ELEMENT may parent a legacy of SECTIONs, which further allow
organization of the component specification, as needed. SECTIONS cannot
parent ELEMENTs, and all sections must share a common ancestral
ELEMENT. SECTIONs may have legacies of other SECTIONS.

There are two BURST DELINEATOR classes for each of the two types of
partition. The BURST DELINEATOR for partitions is also responsible for
defining the package for which it is a member of. This allows for
single partition packages. Where the package name is not provided, it
is derived from the current package name. If a package name is not
provided at the start of the steam, the steam shall be considered
illegal and shall not be processed.

%%`/%%:Standards Partition (%%\%%\?)%%%

The STANDARDS partition contains higher-level standards, concepts,
principals, or similar specifications that are used primarily to
better understand the functionality and interface, but not the use of
the associated package operational components.

STANDARDS partitions are delineated with a BURST DELINEATOR classifier
of '?'

%%`/%%:Operations Partition (%%\%%\!)%%%

The OPERATION partition contains specific function description or
operational instructions for the associated operational components
specified by the package.

OPERATION partitions are delineated with a BURST DELINEATOR classifier
of '!'

%%`%%:Elements%%%

ELEMENTs represent broadly any given component specification or
operational description. ELEMENTs are named, and can be organized
hierarchically, but only as conforms with the Human Relations
Secretariat's Human Reference Notation Standard (see xeris?man%hrns*)

Elements are indicated through the appropriate BURST DELINEATOR code
as listed below. Each element shall also include a reference
identifier as the argument to its delineation code. Element codes
follow HRNS.

BURST DELINEATOR	    ELEMENT CLASSIFIER
'%'			            Secretariat
'$'	                    Operator
'#'			            Service Code
'&'			            Parameter
'/'			            Logical Branch
'#'			            Local reference
'!'			            Comment
'*'			            Standard


%%`//%%:Secretariat '%'%%%

Secretariat ELEMENTs are generally used to refer to the associated
secretariat. The delineation should be given a reference designator as
the delineator argument. The designator should match the HRT reference
of the associated Secretariat.

In typical use, Secretariat classifiers serve as a "top level", as
Secretariats are the fundamental module of the XERIS/APEX system.

%%`//%%:Operator '$'%%%

Operator ELEMENTs generally refer to the associated Operator within a
parent Secretariat. The delineation should be given a reference
designator as the delineator argument. The designator should match the
HRT reference of the associated Operator.

In typical use, Operator Classifiers provide additional information
about the function (STANDARDS) or operation of the particular
operator.

%%`//%%:Service Code '&':%%%

Service Code ELEMENTs generally refer to the associated Service Code
offered by the parent Operator. The delineation should be given a
reference designator as the delineator argument. The designator should
match the HRT reference of the associated Service Code.

In typical use, Service Code Classifiers provide additional
information about the function (STANDARDS) or operational
definition/instructions in regards to the use of the associated
Service Code.

%%%%s%/%d%Burst Packaging%%%

Bursts are contiguous blocks of a complete steam (package) that are
delineated with Burst Marks. Busts Marks carry a standardized set of
relational definitions. Bursts are hierarchical, and data not explicitly
provided in a given Burst Mark is inherited or derived from its
parent.

Packages shall be considered as a contiguous steam of related bursts.
Packages cannot be append to each-other in any circumstance. Packages
shall always be processed in a single, sequential operation. Revised
packages of a higher revision shall replace existing packages of the
same qualifier.

Packages can be contained separately or together, as long as the
package stream's content is processed sequentially. Parallel processing
of multiple packages in a single container (simultaneous steams) is
permitted. Nested packages are not permitted.

Bursts that constitute a package are delineated by Burst Marks, which
both indicate a new burst, and provide data overrides for the
inherited data of the child Burst. If no data overrides are given, the
Burst derives all of its information from it's parent, automatically.

Burst must track the following identification information:

1. Package Identifier
2. Package Sequence
3. Section Sequence
3. Tag/Abbreviation
4. Description
5. Parent (Package Sequence)
5. Child (Package Sequence)
