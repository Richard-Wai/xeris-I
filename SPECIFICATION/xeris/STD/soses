%%:Standard Operational Status and Errors Specification%%.0%%,1%%%

%%`0%%:Introduction%%%

The Standard Operational Status and Errors Specification provides a
standardized specification for Telemetry Reports for all core
components of the XERIS/APEX system, and is also available and
encouraged for use across all implementations where possible.

This specification lists the Specifications and associated Codes for
all Standard Operational Status and Errors, and Telemetry Encoding.

Note the Specification Indexes from 0000 - 00FF are reserved for the
XERIS/APEX System Specification.

Specification Indexes from 0100 - 0FFF shall be considered generally
allocated to mass distributed or otherwise common, non-core
components.

Specification Indexes from 1000 - FFFF shall be used only for
internal, implementation-specific applications. It shall be expected
that externally distributed components will not use indexes within
this range.

%%`/1%%:Human Translation Schema Specification%%%

Each specified SOSES Spec/Code pair may be assigned a specific Human
Translation Schema. The Human Translation Schema specifies the
intended human output of a spec/code pair, and allows for further
specification of the payload/datagram format.

Any Human Translation Schema final output format cannot exceed 80
UTF-8 encoded octets.

%%`/1/1%%:Schema Format Specification%%%

Schemas are represented inline by the Human Translation string
associated with a SOSES Spec/Code pair. The number of schemas per
entry is theoretically unlimited, but the result cannot exceed 80
UTF-8 encoded octets.

Invalid schemas will invalidate the entire translation. Partial
translations shall not be undertaken. If a translation is not
possible, the XERIS Standard Report Encoding Schema should be
implemented (xeris?xsres*).

All inline format schemas shall be delineated by '`' characters (0x60)
at the beginning and end of the schema definition.

Schema encoding is case-sensitive.

The schema format is defined as follows:

`(a)(b)(c)(d)`

%%`1/1/1: (a) - Output Format and Radix%%%

This field shall be only one UTF-8 octet wide, and must be one of the
following 5 possible values. Any other value invalidates the schema.

UTF-8     Format   Radix
s         Signed   Decimal
u         Unsigned Decimal
x         Unsigned Hexadecimal
o         Unsigned Octal
b         Unsigned Binary         

%%`1/1/2: (b) - Word size%%%

This field shall be only one octet wide, and must be one of the
following 3 possible values. Any other value invalidates the schema.

This value represents the data word with that is to be sourced for
conversion.

UTF-8     Word size
1         8 bit
2         16 bit
4         32 bit

%%`1/1/3: (c) - Datagram word offset%%%

This field shall be only one octet wide, and must be one of the
following 3 possible values. Any other value invalidates the schema.

This value indicates the word index (offset) in the 32-bit datagram
region of the report/telemetry ticket.

UTF-8     Index
0         0
1         1
2         2
3         3

%%`1/1/4: (d) - Output conversion clamp/extend length%%%

This field shall be one to three octets wide, and must only
contain UTF-8 encoded digits (0-9) that represent an unsigned decimal
value. This field may be empty. If more than three octets are
supplied, or if any of the octets are not valid digits, the schema is
invalidated.

This value indicates a fixed, constant number of digits (characters)
available for output of the encoded datagram value. If the source
value is larger than can fit into the specified length, it is clamped
to the specified length (truncated towards the most significant
digits).

%%`%%:Spec 0000 - Universal Operational Status Reporting%%%

The Universal Operational Status Reporting Code Specification provides
typical-case, implementation-agnostic status and error codes for most
"typical" operational conditions, specifically for initialization,
termination, and processing. The primary goal of the Universal
Operational Status Reporting specification is to provide the relevant
Telemetry codes for the core XERIS/APEX system (see the MVAS
Specification - xeris?mvas*)

The codes are arranged in logical grouping relative to the most
significant nibble of the Telemetry Code, as follows:

Range         GRP   Description
0000 - 0FFF    S    Information / Status
1000 - 1FFF    I    Initialization messages
2000 - 2FFF    W    Warning messages
3000 - 3FFF    E    Non-fatal Error Messages
4000 - 4FFF    C    Critical Error - Intervention Required
