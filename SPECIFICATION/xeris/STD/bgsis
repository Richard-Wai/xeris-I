%%?xeris%%*BGSIS%%:Base Guaranteed Secretariat Index Specification%%%

%%`1%%:INTRODUCTION%%%

The XERIS/APEX system is specified to be as flexible in implementation
as possible. However, to maintain the best of a universal
specification, and the greatest flexibility, there needs to be some
baseline agreements for the very foundation of the system.

At a fundamental level, XERIS/APEX identifies Secretariats not though
some kind of abstracted file-system, but rather a simple Identification
Index. This is for both efficiency, and security. Through this system,
only the Executive Group members are ever directly exposed to the real
location of any Secretariat within the system. A human-oriented
registry resembling a "file system" is optionally available as one of
the Base Guaranteed Secretariat Index (man%hrt$). Otherwise, this
system is more resource efficient, and can be automated.

In order to generate a reliable specified system, there are a few
basic services and facilities that are assigned a guaranteed specified
index number. Guaranteed means that the Secretariat Index ID that
OPSEC% uses to route Dispatch Orders is guaranteed to be the same
across all XERIS/APEX nodes and implementations, and across all
Releases and Versions of the XERIS/APEX Specification.

It is not, however, guaranteed that all secretariats listed in this
specification will be necessarily present on any given node or tier.


%%`/%%:Operational Groups%%%

Operational Groups are logical divisions of the Guaranteed
Secretariats by general areas of responsibility. The Operational Group
is demarcated by the most significant four bits of the least
significant byte of the Secretariat Identification (SID). It should
be however noted that this logical partitioning is only a specified
feature for organization, and especially for human
intuitiveness. There is no true operational significance to the
stratification. The only technical significance is that operators
:0000% - :00ff% are reserved and of a guaranteed, static assignment
across all XERIS/APEX nodes, regardless of implementation.

Secretariats who's IDs fall within these values shall always be
referred to in this specification.

The Operational Groups (Op Groups) are as follows:

Grp #   Group Designation      SID Reserved Range   HRT Logical Division
0       Executive              :0000% - :000f%      x/

4       Transport              :3000% - :3fff%      t/
5       Infrastructure         :4000% - :4fff%      i/
6       Directorate            :5000% - :5fff%      d/
5       User                   :6000% - :ffff%      u/


%%`0%%:Executive Group (:0000% - :000f%)%%%

The executive group contains all of the very core XERIS/APEX executive
secretariats that provision basic executive capability of a node.

The executive group contains the following static secretariats:

SID       HRT          Human Name             SPEC
%0000     !opsec%      Operations Secretariat xeris!opsec%

%0006     !emerg%      Terminal Emergency     xeris!emerg%

%%`3%%:Support Group (0010% - 0fff%)%%%

The Support Group provides common services for internal use.

The Support Group has registered the following specified:

SID       HRT          Human Name             SPEC
0010      !s/lo%       Loop-back              xeris!s/0010%lo

0014      !s/txc%      Ticket Exchange        xeris!s/0014%swp

%%`2%%:Facilities Group (1000% - 1fff%)%%%

The Facilities Group contains various generalized resource and
operation management secretariats. In contrast to the Support Group,
focuses more on inter-secretarial delegation and public resource
management.

The Facilities Group has registered the following possible
secretariats:

SID       HRT          Human Name
1000      !f/reg%      Registrar General
1001      !f/lea%      Workspace Lease Facility
1002      !f/sync%     Synchronization Facilities
1004      !f/pac%      Permits and Authorization Commission
1005      !f/cyc%      Cyclic Dispatch Commission
1006      !f/cmd%      Command Dispatch Commission
1007      !f/batch%    Batch Dispatch Commission
1234%     !f/man%      Human Relations
                       Secretariat

%%`2%%:Logistics Group (2000% - 2fff%)%%%

The Logistics Group handles high-level inter-nodal communication and
bulk transfer.

The logistics group operates at the highest level, on top of the
Interface and Infrastructure group. It is intended that the XERIS/APEX
may be distributed transparently over any communication or network
topology. Therefore this group focuses on tier coherence, interface,
and inter-operation.

2345%     !l%tty       Human Access Manager    xeris!l/2345%tty


%%`3%%:Transport Group%%%

The Transport Group handles various transport protocol suites for the
support of the Logistics Group in facilitating various data transport
operations and harness interfaces.

Generally, transport group secretariats perform routing, trunking, and
provisioning of data exchange through configured infrastructure
service providers. For example, the t/ip% secretariat will handle
distributing a packet to the appropriate physical interface driver
according to the address. Transparent meshing can also be performed
for non-switched protocols, such as i2c or CAN, if so configured.

User-defined transports may be implemented from 1900-1fff%, but it is
strongly encouraged that they continue to conform to the standard
framework.

Specified Interface Secretariats herein listed shall always conform
to the Universal Transport Framework specification (xeirs?utf*). This
framework outlines a conceptual system-level interface that allows for
a two phase set-up of point-to-point (node-to-node) "tracks"
(0000-ffff per transport).

%%`5%%:Infrastructure Group%%%

The Infrastructure Group focuses on bare-metal management of hardware,
and provides basic, and to the greatest extent possible standardized,
interfaces primarily for the use of the transport and facilities
groups.

Standard class registrars shall register only Class Complaint
secretariats that conform to the relevant Class Registrar
Specification.

Indexes from 4000 - 40ff are reserved for Standard Class Registrars.

Indexes from 4100 - 4fff are not standardized, and are freely
assignable to local infrastructure providers.
