%%*xsres%%:XERIS Standard Report Encoding Schema%%%

%%`0%%:Introduction%%%

When first initialized, it is specified that a XERIS/APEX system must
come-up on a Umbilical Link to it's parent node, and establish this
link as soon as possible. This is the role of the Umbilical Link
Operator (flatline%ulo$) until such time as opsec% is initialized and
the Telemetry, Reports, and Accounting Commissions Executive
(opsec%trace$) commissions a separate operator.

Telemetry may be passed between nodes and upwards through tiers though
any agreed means that maintains the xst_tlm ticket specification (see
specification xeris?xsts*4/15). 

However, the ULO always transmits telemetry sequentially with 8-bit
characters of the ASCII standard. This specification outlines this
standard.

This standard may be maintained with appropriate Operating Mode
operators at the discretion of the implementation.

%%`1%%: Principals%%%

Each Telemetry report shall be transmitted as a single sequential
unit, beginning with the relative or absolute address of the node,
followed by all telemetry contained within the Telemetry Track,
including the additional information stream, if any.

This standard requires a synchronous, or apparently synchronous,
transmission of 8-bit bytes ("characters") that conform to the UTF-8
standard. This is to ensure Human and Machine legibility.

All numeric values shall be coded with UTF-8 encoding, using
HEXADECIMAL (00-FF) format, in UPPER CASE only. The most significant
byte shall always be transmitted first.

All characters that are not control characters, and are not 0-9, A-F,
shall be ignored.

It is encouraged that single Telemetry Reports be followed by a LF and
CR for better Human accessibility. flatline%ulo$ will always do
this. This is not a general requirement of this standard.

%%`2%%:Set-up and Termination Control Sequence%%%

All Telemetry Reports shall be opened with '%%', and closed with
'/%%'. Optionally, a 16-bit Pearson Hash checksum may be appended,
followed by a '?'. 

%%`3%%:Sequence 1: Node Address Path%%%

Immediately following the Set-up sequence ('%%'), the source node
address path is expected before a '!!'. If any other control
characters, except for '@' or '!', are encountered before '!!', the
transmission is invalidated.

The address path may be blank if the telemetry origin node itself is
transmitting the telemetry. In this case, the beginning of the
sequence shall be "%%!!" to indicate that the telemetry source is the
same as the transmitting node.

Each node name in the address path shall be prefixed with an 8-bit
address type code, encoded in hexadecimal/UTF-8, followed by the
control character '@'. If any node in the address path is missing the
type code, the transmission is invalidated.

Node names in an address path shall be terminated with the control
character '!'. Between the '@' and '!' control characters, any string
of UTF-8 encoded characters is permitted, except for any of the
control characters. Any unexpected control characters will invalidate
the transmission.

%%`4%%:Sequence 2: Secretariat/Operator Identifier%%%

Following the node address path, terminated by '!!', an exactly 16-bit
Secretariat ID (SID) of the originating Secretariat on the originating
Node shall be provided in HEX format (4 UTF-8 Characters). This shall
then be terminated with a '%' control character. If any unexpected
character is encountered, the transmission is invalidated.

Following the SID, an Operator ID from that Secretariat shall be
provided, immediately following '%'. It shall be an exactly 16-bit
Operator ID of the originating Operator of the originating
Secretariat, in HEX format (4 UTF-8 Characters). This shall then be
terminated with a '$' control character. If any unexpected character
is encountered, the transmission is invalidated.

The SID is Node-specific, and the Operator is specific to the
originating Secretariat.

%%`5%%:Sequence 3: Category Code%%%

Following the Secretariat and Operator Identifiers, terminated with
'$', an exactly 8-bit Category Code shall be provided in HEX format (2
UTF-8 Characters).

Refer to the XERIS Standard Ticket Specification, xst_tlm
(xeris?xsts*4/15) for appropriate category codes.

The category shall be terminated with a '&' control character. If any
unexpected character is encountered, the transmission is invalidated.
