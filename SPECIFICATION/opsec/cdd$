%%:OPSEC% Central Dispatch Desk (CDD$)%%%

%%`0%%:Overview%%%

The OPSEC% Central Dispatch Desk is directly analogous to the standard
"Local Dispatch Desk", and has an identical role of routing incoming
Dispatch Orders to the appropriate Operator. The distinguished name
exists due to its unique access method compared to other local
Secretariats, as being the only Dispatch Desk accessible directly by
all Secretariats under OSPEC%'s jurisdiction.

Indeed, the Central Dispatch Desk is, as the name implies, the first
stop for all outbound Dispatch Orders.

%%`1%%:Track Groups%%%

As with all XERIS/APEX complaint Secretaries, the Dispatch Desk routes
inbound Dispatch Orders via Static and Dynamic Tracks. However, due to
the greater powers and responsibilities of OPSEC%, the Static Tracks
of OPSEC% has some dynamic properties, and the Dynamic Tracks are also
not universal to all incoming Dispatches.

For these reasons, the Central Dispatch Desk refers to available
inbound tracks as two groups: Provisioned Tracks, and Leased Tracks.

%%`/1%%:Provisioned Tracks%%%

Provisioned Tracks are a set of guaranteed Static-like tracks that are
provided to each local Secretariat through the Central Dispatch
Desk. Unlike "traditional" Static Tracks, the Provisioned Tracks are
directly associated with the facing Secretariat.

Tracks 0000 to 00FF are reserved for Provisioned Tracks exclusively.

Provisioned Tracks are as follows:

Track     Operator    Assigned Task
0000      trk$        Track Lease Application Processing
0001      bcm$        Back-channel Management
0002      tla$        Telemetry Aggregator
0003      paac$       Permit Applications and Renewals
0004      eca$        Unhanded Exception Containment
0005      cns$        Consignment Management

%%`/2%%:Leased Tracks%%%

Leased Tracks are applied for by any Secretariat in order to open a
dispatch track to another Secretariat's Operator/Track within OPSEC%'s
jurisdiction. Leased tracks can have various parameters and limits
which can be imposed on a Secretariat depending on various
configurable factors such as Security Level, Resource Limitation, and
Responsibilities.
