%%:OPSEC% Dispatch Supervisor (super$)%%%

%%`0%%:Executive Summary%%%

The supervisor represents the local OPSEC% interface presented to a
dispatch. Ordinarily, OPSEC% itself is inaccessible to all except the
highest security level Secretariats. However SUPER$ is universally
acceptable.

When a dispatch makes a XERIS call to OPSEC%SUPER$ (0000%0000$), the
Case File is transferred directly to SUPER$. Any other XERIS call to
0000% will result in a normal Case File transfer to OPSEC% through
OPSEC%'s Dispatch Desk.

SUPER$ Provides a collection of standard operational features to allow
simple dispatch flow and Tier Horizon interfacing. The two primary
facilities provided by SUPER$ are:

1. Transaction Control, and
2. Standard Services Advice

%%`1%%: Transaction Control%%%

Transaction Control services provided by OPSEC% allow Operators to
delineate serialized procedures which are not to be entered
simultaneously.

Transaction Control has two phases: Post, and Commit.

When an Operator posts a transaction, they provide a related Signal
object reference to OPSEC%SUPER$. After posting the transaction, the
Operator can then be assured that no other dispatch in the local
jurisdiction will execute the same transaction until the transaction
is Committed.
