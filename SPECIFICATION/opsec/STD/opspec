%%:OPSEC% Operational Specification%%%

%%`0%%:Role of OPSEC% in the XERIS/APEX System%%%

A core operating philosophy of the XERIS/APEX system is the clear and
focused division of roles among Secretariats and their Operators. The
Secretariat should cover a specific area of responsibility, while its
constituent Operators and Assistants execute specific tasks which
together allow the responsibility to be covered in all situations.

It is important in the design and specification of the XERIS/APEX
system that exceptions and special treatment be limited as far as
possible, and that consistent rules predominate.

Though OPSEC% may seem to have a very special role in the XERIS/APEX
system, it is really just one of many Secretariats within a local
node. The only single exception that truly sets OPSEC% apart from
other Secretariats lies in the special access method afforded to
OPSEC%. That is: OPSEC% is the only Secretariat who's Dispatch Desk
may be accessed directly by any other Secretariat within a node. It
should be emphasized: this is the one and only distinction.

OPSEC% has this special provision due to its specific
responsibility. OPSEC%, or the Operations Secretariat, as it's name
suggests, has the responsibility of handling Operations within the
local node in which it resides.

%%`1%%:Defining the Responsibility of the Operations Secretariat%%%

Each Executive Core within a given Tier of a XERIS/APEX system is
managed by a singular OPSEC% local to that core. Executive Cores
generally refer to a finite collection of memory and compute
resources, such that the collection is restricted to sequential
instruction execution.

OPSEC%s is assigned to it a "fleet" (the Executive Fleet) of "trucks"
that are essentially moving contexts, which are assigned a dispatch. All
trucks are provided to OPSEC% by the local STARLINE% (the Stratified
Tier Assignments and Reporting Liaison Interface Node Executive).
STARLINE%. OPSEC%'s responsibility is to properly schedule and marshal
all assigned trucks and supervise their assigned dispatch roles.

%%`1%%:Operating from within OPSEC%%%

As an operator executing as part of a dispatch, OPSEC% provides a
single services interface through the Central Dispatch Desk
(opsec%cdd$). When an operator wishes to submit a dispatch order, it
does so by submitting directly to the opsec%cdd$. cdd$ then forwards
the dispatch ticket on the selected outbound track to recipient
secretariat.

%%`1/1%%:Executive Dispatch Handling%%%

Upon receipt of an inbound dispatch, besides carrying-out local actions
as required, the operator can only SUBMIT a new dispatch, or RETURN a
completed dispatch.

The SUBMIT action is the only true "system call" in the XERIS/APEX
system. SUBMIT takes two arguments: a XERIS Standard Dispatch Order,
and the requested outbound Track.
