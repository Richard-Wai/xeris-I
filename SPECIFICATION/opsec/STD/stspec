%%2%%:OPSEC Central Operational Data Structure%%%

The Central Operational Data Structure maintains all globally
accessible operational information that is used throughout OPSEC%. The
structure is partitioned according to the responsible manager of that
partition, which shall be a single Operator with OPSEC. Only the
responsible manager is permitted to modify the information under its
responsibility. Any other operator may read any of the shared data
structures.

The operational design of OPSEC% prevents interrupted writes where the
interuptee may obtain corrupted or outdated information. Operators will
use private semaphores on their discretion to prevent write
corruptions during possible reentrancy due to scheduler preemption.
