%%:OPSEC% Executive Fleet Marshal (XFM$)%%%

%%`0%%:Executive Overview%%%

The Executive Fleet Marshal handles the progression of "Trucks" within
a single executive core. Under the assumption that a single opsec% is
assigned to its own executive core, XFM$ provides the marshaling
services to the rest of OPSEC%, as well as fleet maintenance
functions for FLATLINE% and MPL%.

XFM$ is responsible only for atomically updating the marshal-out truck
registration file on marshal-out, as well as setting the immediate
truck registration file pointer in the OPSEC Central Account.

%%`1%%:Operational Overview

XFM$ Provides only a single operation, which is to marshal-out the
current Truck, and then marshal-in the indicated Truck.

XFM$ is only accessible from within opsec%, without exception. For
this reason and also for performance considerations, XFM$ does not
receive or return a standard or non-standard ticket. XFM$ receives
directly an xfm_trf pointer, and returns in kind.

XFM$ will check the stack limit and update the Truck Registration File
accordingly to indicate a Warning or Excursion. XFM$ will then check
the marshal-in file for a "Active" or "Warning" Status. If it finds
any other status, XFM$ will abort the marshal (transparently).

If the marshal-in truck matches the immediate TRF, the only adverse
affect would be wasted cycles. It is the responsibility of OPSEC%XS$
and OPSEC%INT$ to properly delegate marshal orders.

%%`2%%:Standard of Return%%%

XFM$ will always return an xfm_trf pointer, indicating the marshal-out
Truck of the entrant marshal. If the marshal was aborted, the returned
"marshal-out" Truck reference would be identical to the Immediate
Truck.

%%`3%%:Truck Registration File Specification%%%

The Truck Registration File (xfm_trf) is intended to carry a single
Dispatch, and allows for opsec% to schedule the executive core to
multiple simultaneous dispatches by marshaling trucks.

The Truck Registration File sets out a stack frame via a base, mark,
and limit pointer.

The Truck Registration File also allows status indications and
monitoring for containment of stack overflows, as well as allowing
Total Context Transfers in and out of an Executive Core.

Trucks are referenced by the Dispatch File to which they are assigned,
but do not reference any assignment internally. Trucks are provided
externally, and generally provisioned through the actions of the
Mission Planning Liaison secretariat (MPL%).

OPSEC% allocates a truck internally for its own operations to avoid
inadvertent stack exhaustion, particularly during interrupt service
routines (int$) and the Operational Scheduler (os$).
