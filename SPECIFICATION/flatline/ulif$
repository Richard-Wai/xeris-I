%%!flatline%%$ulif%%Umbilical Link Interface%%%

%%`1%%:Description%%%

The Umbilical Link Interface is a specified universal interface for
trunked or single device-specific serial link interface drivers for
early-stage node inception monitoring and control from the node
parent.

The ULIF% supports the Simple Line Interface Specification (xeris?slis)
and thus responds to only four operations: Initialize interface,
Transmit String, Receive String, and Release Interface. 

The ULIF should be as simple as possible to serve the basic required
functions. As per the general FLATLINE% operational specification,
only stack space may be used. The system will be effectively halted
during character reads before OPSEC% is operational, if no input
character is available. For these reasons, the ULIF$ shall only be
accessed by FLATLINE%ULO$.

ULIF$ is not for chit-chat.

%%`2%%:Accepted Manifests%%%

ULIF$ only accepts Service Request tickets (SRQ Manifests).

%%`%%:Service Requests%%%

Accepted Service Request Codes are listed as follows:

Value   Code       Description
0000    ULIF_TXS   Transmit string
0001    ULIF_RXS   Receive string
0002    ULIF_INI   Initialize Driver
0003    ULIF_RLS   Release Driver

%%`2/0%%:ULIF-TXS - Transmit String%%%

A null-terminated string shall be placed in a buffer attached to the
Case Board, and with the Case Board Size set to the maximum size of
the buffer, or the desired string transmission length. The
transmission will end at either the first NUL character encountered,
or the extent of the buffer, whichever comes first.

A hard limit exists of 0xfff bytes. ULIF$ will not transmit more than
this amount in any circumstance.

ULIF$ will always return a XERIS Standard Report ticket, which will be
one of three possible results:

Stub   Spec/Code   SOSES             Description
CPL    0000/0001   OP-S-OPR_OK       Transmission complete
RJT    0000/5012   OP-F-CB_CONFIG    Case Board config Unacceptable
UNA    0000/5005   OP-F-WRITE_UNABLE Transmission failed

For successful transmissions, ULIF$ will confirm the number of
transmitted characters by returning the number in the adi16[0] field
of the report ticket.

%%`2/1%%:ULIF-RXS - Transmit String%%%

A buffer shall be provided, attached to the Case Board, and with the
Case Board Size set to the maximum size of the buffer, or the intended
number of characters to be received. ULIF$ will continue to wait for
character receipt until it reaches the provided Case Board Size in
characters.

A practical limit of 80 characters is implemented. Receive requests of
greater than 80 characters will result in a return after 80 characters
are received.

ULIF$ will always return a XERIS Standard Report ticket, which will be
one of three possible results:

Stub   Spec/Code   SOSES             Description
CPL    0000/0001   OP-S-OPR_OK       Receipt complete
RJT    0000/5012   OP-F-CB_CONFIG    Case Board Config Unacceptable
UNA    0000/5006   OP-F-READ_UNABLE  Transmission failed

For successful transmissions, ULIF$ will confirm the number of
transmitted characters by returning the number in the adi16[0] feild
of the report ticket.

%%`2/2%%:ULIF_INI - Initialize Driver%%%

The Initialized Interface Request is intended to be called from
FLATLINE%SYSBOOT$ initially. The ULIF_INI Service Request will
initialize all physical links included in the node-specific ULIF$
package.

The Request will always return with a Report Ticket, with one of the
three following possible returns:

Stub    Spec/Code Pair   SOSES             ADI (adi8)
CPL     0000/1009        OP-I-INIT_OK      TX + RX
UNA     0000/5000        OP-F-INIT_FATAL   TX + RX
PAR     0000/0004        OP-S-WRITE_ONLY   TX + RX (LSB)


%%`2/3/0%%:CPL - Initialization Complete%%%

CPL indicates ULIF$ has initialized at least one TX and at least one
RX line. CPL indicates a "normal" initialization of a bi-directional
Umbilical Link.

%%`2/3/1%%:UNA - Unable to Initialize%%%

UNA indicates a Fatal Error, where no TX lines available. RX lines may
still be available.

%%`2/3/2%%:PAR - Partial Initialization%%%

PAR indicates that a TX-only connection has been established.

%%`2/3%%:ULIF_REL - Release Driver%%%

The Release Driver never fails. This service request always returns a
XERIS Standard Report ticket of the following configuration:

Stub    Spec/Code Pair   SOSES             ADI
CPL     0000/0002        OP-S-REQUEST_CPL  None

%%`4%%:Unrecognized Service Request%%%

An invalid Service Requests code will always result in a XERIS
Standard Report ticket with the following configuration:

Stub    Spec/Code Pair   SOSES             ADI
RJT     0000/5002        OP-F-SVC_UNAVAIL  None
